# Fair Rations

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/fair-rations/problem<br>

approach:
if we get the total array of summiton is sum % 2 == 1, thats mean odd number of value, we return No.<br>

else, we found the odd number value, then increase this value with 1, and also its next (i + 1) element value.<br>
and count = count + 2, (we change two element at a time)<br>
