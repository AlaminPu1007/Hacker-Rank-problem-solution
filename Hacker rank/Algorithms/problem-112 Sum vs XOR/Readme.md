## Sum vs XOR

[problem link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sum-vs-xor/problem)

**Approach :**<br>

- we have to just find out how many 0 bit is present in given `n` by using `&` operator
- and multiply each with previous one, so on

**Complexity :**<br>

- Time-Complexity: `O(log(n))`
- Space-Complexity: `O(1)`
