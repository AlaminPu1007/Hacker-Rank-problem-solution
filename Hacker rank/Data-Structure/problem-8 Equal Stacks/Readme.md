## Equal Stacks

[Visit Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/equal-stacks/problem)

**Approach :**<br>

-   Get `summation` of all array by using c++ predefined accumulate method.[Accumulate Method](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/array-sum-in-cplusplus-stl)
-   run a `while` loop until all array summation are not going to be equal
-   `return` any of array `summation`

**Complexity Analysis :**<br>

-   Time-Complexity: `O(n)`
-   Space-Complexity: `O(1)`, we are not using any kind of extra space(approximately)
