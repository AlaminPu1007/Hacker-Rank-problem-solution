in this problem we have to check given string is possible to make palindrome or not.</br>
we have to follow just few steps

i) if(freq[i] % 2 == 1) 
   counter++;

ii)  if( len % 2 == 1 )
    {
        if(count == 1)
        {
            printf("YES\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }
if given string length is satisfied %(modules) condition && count == 1

iii) if count == 0,

according this three mejor, given string will be possible to make palindrome
